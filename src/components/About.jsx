                            As a software engineer I often gather, define and interpret business requirements, to design, build, enhance, test and deploy modern web applications. It is my goal to help businesses solve problems using software development. Whether working independently or within a team setting, I am able to juggle multiple projects while managing quality, communication and creativity. I am always available to chat with you about your next project, so let's connect. I look forward to speaking with you.
                        </p>

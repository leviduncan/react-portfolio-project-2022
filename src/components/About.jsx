                                Hi I'm Darrin. As a web developer I add value by designing, developing, enhancing, testing and deploying modern web applications with an end goal of creating engaging and user-friendly experiences. I gather, define or interpret business requirements, and troubleshoot and fix bugs. I have juggled projects with multiple development and creative teams or run solo as a consultant. I am always available to chat with you about your next project, so let's connect. I look forward to speaking with you.
                        </p>
